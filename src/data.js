        title: 'HTTP vs HTTPS',
        article: 'HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol. It’s a protocol that allows communication between different systems. Most commonly, it is used for transferring data from a web server to a browser to view web pages.The problem is that HTTP (note: no "s" on the end) data is not encrypted, and it can be intercepted by third parties to gather data being passed between the two systems.This can be addressed by using a secure version called HTTPS, where the "S" stands for secure. This involves the use of an SSL certificate -- "SSL" stands for secure sockets layer -- which creates a secure encrypted connection between the web server and the web browser.'

        article: 'The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources. Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.1.1 (in IPv4), or more complex newer alphanumeric IP addresses such as 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2'

        article: 'The Internet protocol suite is the conceptual model and set of communications protocols used in the Internet and similar computer networks. It is commonly known as TCP/IP because the foundational protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP). The Internet protocol suite provides end-to-end data communication specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received.'

        article: 'A web server is server software, or hardware dedicated to running this software, that can satisfy client requests on the World Wide Web. A web server can, in general, contain one or more websites. A web server processes incoming network requests over HTTP and several other related protocols. The primary function of a web server is to store, process and deliver web pages to clients.[1] The communication between client and server takes place using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Pages delivered are most frequently HTML documents, which may include images, style sheets and scripts in addition to the text content.'

        title: 'Caching',
        article: 'In computing, a cache is a high-speed data storage layer which stores a subset of data, typically transient in nature, so that future requests for that data are served up faster than is possible by accessing the data’s primary storage location. Caching allows you to efficiently reuse previously retrieved or computed data. The data in a cache is generally stored in fast access hardware such as RAM (Random-access memory) and may also be used in correlation with a software component. A caches primary purpose is to increase data retrieval performance by reducing the need to access the underlying slower storage layer.'

        title: 'Traditional Web Hosting vs. Cloud Computing',
        article: 'Traditional data centres consist of various pieces of hardware, such as a desktop computer, which are connected to a network via a remote server. This server is typically installed on the premises, and provides all employees using the hardware, access to the business’s stored data and applications. On the other hand, traditional IT infrastructures are considered to be one of the most secure data hosting solutions and allows you to maintain full control of your company’s applications and data on the local server. They are a customised, dedicated system ideal for organisations that need to run many different types of applications. Cloud computing is far more abstract as a virtual hosting solution. Instead of being accessible via physical hardware, all servers, software and networks are hosted in the cloud, off premises. It’s a real-time virtual environment hosted between several different servers at the same time. So rather than investing money into purchasing physical servers in-house, you can rent the data storage space from cloud computing providers on a more cost effective pay-per-use basis.'

        title: 'Static vs. Dynamic pages',
        article: 'Websites are separated into two different types: static and dynamic. Static websites are ones that are fixed and display the same content for every user, usually written exclusively in HTML. A dynamic website, on the other hand, is one that can display different content and provide user interaction, by making use of advanced programming and databases in addition to HTML. Static websites use only client-side HTML and CSS code while dynamic websites rely on both client-side and server-side scripting languages such as JavaScript, PHP, or ASP. When a user accesses a dynamic website, the site can be changed through code that is run in the browser and/or on the server. The end result is the same as that on a static website: an HTML page displayed on the web browser.'
